I am a Data Scientist for [L&Q](https://www.lqgroup.org.uk/), where I'm helping L&Q better serve the business using data science from: automating dynamic reporting and applying statistics to solving underlying issues impacting the business.

Previously I worked in analytical roles at Jacobs a Fortune 500 company and I enjoy contributing towards a positive business impact.

I have a masters in Civil Engineering at [Loughborough University](https://www.lboro.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/courses/a-z/civil-engineering-meng/). I am keen a member at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/richieone13) and enjoy keeping up with the AI applications and how we can benefit society. These include A/B testing, training ML models for supervised, unsupervised learning. ðŸ¤–ðŸ’¬
