Hi! I'm Richie Wong, I recently joined as a Analytics Engineer at Checkout.com. A bit about me, I grew up in Bristol and have been living in London for the past 6 years.

Prior to that I was working at a Fintech company called GetGround who are a property investment platform where I was a Senior BI analyst. I specialise in transforming data, gathering requirements and building reports and dashboards. Throughout my career I have helped companies by built scalable and manageable data products. I ensured they have trusted data which is something that I am really passionate in.

Previously I worked in analytical roles at Jacobs, a Fortune 500 company at an engineering consultancy, I have also worked with Network Rail where I have built self service BI dashboards for their infrastructure assets. I have a masters in Civil Engineering at [Loughborough University](https://www.lboro.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/courses/a-z/civil-engineering-meng/).

Whilst living in London I love trying out different street food and cycling around exploring different areas. I am also a keen doing CrossFit and participate in a local basketball league.

Feel free to reach out to me through LinkedIn, and you can find me on [Medium @richiewong](https://medium.com/@richiewong) where I'll be blogging about data and tech related.
