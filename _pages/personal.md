When I'm not working, I have a number of hobbies. I enjoy gaming with friends. I also cycle, and I enjoy using my Brompton where I've recently cycled from London to Brighton. In addition, I like playing basketball and I have organised a team to participate in a local league.

Before the lockdown my last holiday was in New York ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸, where I really enjoy eating the varierty of different pizzas and appreicating the famous architecture as I did study civil engineering.
