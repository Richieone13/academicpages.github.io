When I'm not working, I have a number of hobbies. I enjoy gaming with friends. I also cycle, and I really enjoy my Brompton where I recently cycled from London to Brighton and enjoy the scenary on the way. In addition, I really enjoy playing basketball, as it's a team sport and organising a team to participate in a local league.

Before lockdown my last holiday was in New York ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸, where I really enjoy eating the varierty of different pizzas and appreicating the famous architecture as I did study civil engineering.
